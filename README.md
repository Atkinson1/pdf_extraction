# pdf_extraction

This repository contains code to show how to extract both text data and tables from a PDF.
The file beginning with "as-the-covid..." contains the PDF that was used for extraction.

### pdf_extraction.rmd & pdf_extraction.pdf
pdf_extraction.pdf contains output from the code created in pdf_extraction.rmd.
In these files, I show how to pull pdf from the text and assort each sentence into a row;
create tokens of words from each sentence, removing stop words;
and finally create a wordcloud of the most popular words in the document.

### pdf_table_extraction.rmd & pdf_table_extraction.pdf
pdf_table_extraction.pdf contains output from the code created in pdf_table_extraction.rmd
In these files, I show how to pull a particular table from a pdf containing multiple tables;
several steps to clean and tidy the data;
and finally create a quick plot.
